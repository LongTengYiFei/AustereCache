1. LBAIndex, CAIndex <- LBABucket, CABucket <- Bucket.
2. Derived classes of Bucket implement different kinds of cache eviction policy. Specifically, Bucket provide data and interfaces, while derived classes implement them and control on the data.
3. Currently only byte-level allocation is implemented, for finer-grained controll, bit-level memory allocation for Bucket is needed.
4. Google Test framework has been integrated.

1. Device -> BlockDevice -> DeviceWithCache (Manage two devices)
2. Bring in MurmurHash3 to compute Fingerprint
3. Plan to modify byte-level bucket to bit-level bucket
